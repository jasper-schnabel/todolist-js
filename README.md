## Reason

I build this tiny webapp to learn and practice HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I wanted to get to know CRUD Operations (**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, **D**elete) and to have fun.

## Running (Linux)

```sh
# Clone the repository and change into it:
git clone https://github.com/jasper-schnabel/todolist-js.git
cd todolist-js

# Run the app
firefox index.html
```

## Todo

- [ ] save tasks with `localStorage`
- [ ] make the website responsive
